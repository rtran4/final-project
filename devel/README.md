# Instructions for Running my Project

It's pretty straight forward. Just open the .py and tun the program. I am having a really hard time trying to get the program to find a winner, so it will keep running. It's a connect four board and it takes turns between Red and Yellow. It's not against an AI so you're both the Red and the Yellow.
